Thus, the company had to raise additional venture capital. Samantha and Jocelyn took Hopscotch through two rounds of funding, in 2013 and again in 2015, and they raised $1.2 million. \n\nEventually, the Hopscotch team realized that with continual growth, but lack of revenue, they would need to constantly look for more investment, but they didn’t want to run the risk of going out of business if they couldn’t manage to continue to raise money, so they decided to switch to a paid subscription model.",

What I'd have said is:\n\nMark instead of bouncing back and forth about numbers and ownership share...  \n\n1. You told me about how much it changed your kid's lives - what if we could do the same for all the kids of the USA, or even the world? \n\n2. Your foundation is the perfect vehicle to get it to grow and infront of people who not only deserve it but can truly better their lives. How much do you want your name and foundation attached to this knowing the difference first hand on what Hopscotch can do, not only from your kid's  lives but those your foundation works for?",

I just woke up, so don't jump on me if my numbers are wrong but Im pretty sure after getting an offer she actually raised the value of the company, lol.

It isn't like he and his daughter broadcasted this game.\n\nSecond, privacy laws surrounding children are incredibly tough in the US. No sane company deals in children's products. This is why Facebook and other platforms have age requirements. This isn't because these companies give a care, rather, they don't want the legal landmines.",

Nobody in the Shark Tank nor in these low IQ youtube comments realized this. So obviously she made a mistake with her math because she obviously wouldn't counter-offer with a HIGHER valuation lmao. Thankfully she caught herself and realized her mistake, and did 600k for 10% (6 mil valuation). Just doing the math so you dummies don't have to :)",

Children should be taught to operate businesses legally and their legal guardians must file business liscences where applicable like any other business owner. So this app is really not needed kids can use cash pay apps already, but the reason lemonade stands are outta business isn't a digital world it's regulations to control sanitation and safety. One cannot even make lip balm or bath bombs without a home inspection to ensure customer safety. Those offering food sales from home using even one piece of commercial equipment in this county of NC are required to offer public restrooms. So child operated businesses are challenging for a child to truly operate themselves. They need adults to do the majority. Anyhow there are labor laws to consider. Does the child want to run a business or is the child asked to run a business?",
