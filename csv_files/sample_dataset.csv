We want to build an eco-tourism in this area. The development of the Beri Panchpota Ecotourism center will benefit millions of people in at least three assembly constituencies in West Bengal. We want, this tourism project should be developed in collaboration with the central and state government both. 



         But, I am sorry to inform you that there was no initiative to build Ecotourism at Beri Panchpota in west bengal till now, even after meeting with Honorable Secretary (Tourism) Mr. Arvind Singh.

This is with reference to the issue i have faced for which i would like to lodge complaint against BSNL Kalyani Exchange wherein they have issued Duplicate SIM which is in my mother&#39;s name (Aruna Chakraborty) without my permission and knowledge hence I would like to register this complaint and would like necessary actions to be taken.

BSNL Kalyani Exchange which has carried out this transaction in issuance of the SIM Card on 17th Dec 2022 was confirmed with BSNL customer care on the said date for the following number: X4X7X2X3X2

I would also like to inform you that I will be taking legal actions for the same as because of this mistake in issuing the SIM without verifying the details has caused financial fraud in my savings account on 19th Dec 2022 amounting to Rs.13,74,000.

I also went to Kalyani BSNL exchange on 22nd Dec and they have shared the documents with which the Duplicate SIM was issued and on looking at those we could clearly see the documents were fake and were not verified by BSNL Officials.

I am also attaching the fake documents I have received from the exchange which was used to issue the SIM Card along with the Original Document.

        I‌ Shankar Ganesh P.J (Employee XDX X0X0X8 and PAN# X-X-X-X-X)., from 24th April 2017 till 15th December 2021 was working as Staff Engineer at Infoblox Technical Support and Software Development Private Limited, Unit No 02 in Office 1 (Level 4), Golden Heights, Dr. Rajkumar Road, 1/2, 59th C Cross, 4th M Block, Rajajinagar Bangalore – 560 010.

Member ID/Name: X-X-X-X-X / SHANKAR GANESH P J
UAN: X0X3X7X6X2X7

To hide their fraud, the company Infoblox has not provided my EPF, Form-16 for the financial year 2021 to 2022 and deliberately withheld my Form-16, all Tax statements, payslips showing break-up, gross &amp; net salary. Infoblox is intentionally doing this to harass me. Even after submitting my grievance XOXEX/X/X0X2X0X9X6 in EPFO, still my EPF money was not transferred by Infoblox. Infoblox deliberately did not mark my Exit and also I got cheated by Infoblox for (X-X-X-X-X) for not matching Employee contribution to Employer contribution ratio. I am bringing this to your kind attention.


 I humbly pray and request you to initiate appropriate action as against Infoblox Technical Support and Software Development Private Limited to match Employee contribution to Employer contribution, mark my Exit and kindly request you to recover my EPF amount from Infoblox and transfer to my current EPF account with interest.

 

Your faithfully,

It is an undeveloped hill cum inter remote area and has been cut out from other part of mainstream area of this country since long time. The network connectivity and internet penetration for Telecommunication is very poor and even not working properly. The residents of this village, students and other business personalities are unable to access the internet for their banking and other online services. The students are also unable to attend any online activities due to above mentioned problems. The people are unable to call the ambulance, fire services due to the lack of network problem during emergency time. The facilities of digital India has not reached to these area till now. They have been underprivileged and digitally not connected with rest of the country.

        He got a job on a compassionate basis. But he produces false/fake documents at the time of appointment on compassionate grounds. It&#39;s a subject of investigation. 
       Kindly verify his documents and their both sisters documents so that you come to a conclusion.
       At the time of birth of Md. Salim on 01/04/1985 his Father Name was Md. Husain after his Younger Sister’s birth on 15/09/1990 her Father Name was Md. Ainul Haque and her Mother’s name is same  Halima Khatun.
     Where is his other father? Which he has not mentioned anywhere. It could also mean that he had killed her and thrown her away. It comes under suspicion. It is also under doubt that which of his father was work in the Railway.
    If he got a job in the name of the first father then what did he do with the second father and if he got a job in the name of the second father then what did he do with the first father. It is often doubted.
    How did he get a compassionate job? 
    In whose name is he doing the job?

दिनांक 31 दिसंबर 2022 को मैं भारतीय स्टेट बैंक के  Home Branch शाखा बाढ़ में दोपहर 12:01 PM को  इंटरनेट बैंकिंग के पासवर्ड रिसेट के लिए गया था। वहां कर्मचारियों की उपस्थिति कम थी जिसके वजह से मैं Deputy Branch manager महोदय जी के केबिन में अपनी समस्या सुनाने चला गया,परंतु उन्होंने मेरा समस्या सुनने से इंकार कर दिया और भला बुरा कह कर वहां से भगा दिया।
उन्होंने कहां कि मैं ये सब फालतू काम के लिए नहीं बैठा हूं तुमलोग नौटंकी करने आ जाते हो।
सबसे बड़ी बात ये है कि बैंक में उस वक्त ज्यादा ग्राहक भी मौजूद नहीं थे‌।
उनका अमर्यादित भाषा तहजीब की हदें पार कर के ग्राहक को ये एहसास करा रहा था कि जैसे हम ग्राहक नाली के कीड़े हैं।हालांकि बड़े पदों पर बैठकर कुछ लोग आसमान में उड़ने लगते हैं जोकि पतन का कारण बनता है।
आला अधिकारी महोदय जी से मेरा अनुरोध है कि उप शाखा प्रबंधक महोदय जी पर उचित कार्यवाही करके बैंकिंग सेवा को सुदृढ़ एवं बैंककर्मी तथा ग्राहक के बीच एक स्वस्थ समन्वय स्थापित कराने का पहल किया जाय।

दुर्भाग्यवश मैं अपना ATM Pin, Internet banking password और CIF number इत्यादि भुल चुका हूं।
इसी संदर्भ में मदद लेने गया था परंतु आपत्तिजनक शब्दों से मेरा हृदय छलनी हो गया।
इस शाखा में इतिहास रहा है सभी पदासिन उच्च पद पर के लोग सदैव अकड़ और तेवर में रहते हैं। 
शिकायत दर्ज कराने के उपरांत कस्टमर को टारगेट करते हैं उन्हें अनावश्यक रूप से परेशान करते हैं।

कृपया इस मामले में उचित कार्यवाही अवश्य करें ताकि देश के अंदर उपभोक्ता के अधिकार का हनन ना हो।
साहेब समय जितना बहुमूल्य आपका है उतना ही बहुमूल्य एक आम अनपढ़ ग्राहक का भी है। कृपया ग्राहकों के साथ ऐसा भेदभाव होने से बचाएं।

धन्यवाद आभार

Dear Sir,
I have when working in various organizations since last 11 years and I have never faced issue in making EPF &amp; EPS transfer and I thank you for that. But my last claim got reject saying my father&#39;s name is incorrect and EPS not deposited because of my organizations mistake.

My previous organization has made multiple requests to correct the father&#39;s name and EPS deposit, even after 6 months the issue has not be resolved.

Since I do not stay in Maharashtra it is difficult for me to travel to PF office Bandra to get this sorted physically. So requesting you to sort this issue with smooth transfer of EPF &amp; EPS to new PF account.

My account is a NRO prime scheme account which requires Rs.25000 as monthly balance, I am maintaining this balance for last 3 months (attached the statement).  I am getting repeated emails about Non-maintenance of minimum balance for my Axis bank account (attached the email received on X1X1X/X0X2X) even though my account has the required minimum balance. 
The bank changes its minimum balance requirement without intimating the customer and deducts Rs.600 for non-maintenance of minimum balance. I have emailed/telephoned several times to the branch (Axis bank-Kondotty) to resolve this issue.  I wanted to close my bank account in this branch due to poor customer service.
The bank offererd to convert my account to a normal account with minimum balance requirement of Rs 5000, but did not do that too.
I have visited Axis Bank, Kondotty branch several times during June-July 2022 for closure of my bank account in this branch.  I have submitted the necessary forms for closing the account. But no action has been taken yet from bank’s side for the same.
I have also submitted the form for cancelation of a standing order on an expired credit card and no update has been received regarding this till date.
I am no longer interested to keep an account in this bank.
Kindly direct the bank to close this account via online after giving option to transfer the balance amount to other bank account via online. There is no provision to back home to cancel this account, which I did months back and no action was taken from bank’s side.
