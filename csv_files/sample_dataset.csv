Sir,


       After meeting reg development of Beri Panchpota Ecotourism in west bengal with Honorable Secretary (Central Tourism Ministry) Mr. Arvind Singh, nearly Eight months passed. There was no initiative to build Ecotourism at Beri Panchpota in west bengal till now. 


       The Beri Panchpota village at Gaighata Block in westbengal is situated 70 km away from Kolkata city in India. Five horse nail shaped lakes (Natural oxbow Lake) flowing in this village. Two biggest lake in this village are Beri lake (8.23 Km long) and Duma lake (14 km long). Others lake are approximately 6 km, 4 km and 3.5 km long. All lakes are naturally developed, and stunningly beautiful sweet rainwater fed water body. All lakes boasts of natural habitats of traditional small fishes, birds, tortoise, flora and fauna. We want to build an eco-tourism in this area. The development of the Beri Panchpota Ecotourism center will benefit millions of people in at least three assembly constituencies in West Bengal. We want, this tourism project should be developed in collaboration with the central and state government both. 



         But, I am sorry to inform you that there was no initiative to build Ecotourism at Beri Panchpota in west bengal till now, even after meeting with Honorable Secretary (Tourism) Mr. Arvind Singh.

1.       The promotion and development of tourism including eco-tourism is primarily the responsibility of State Government/ UT Administrations.

2.       However, the Ministry of Tourism, under its various scheme guidelines provides financial assistance to State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations for development of tourism related infrastructure in the country.

3.       The projects undertaken for development by the Ministry are identified in consultation with State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations / Central Agencies and are sanctioned subject to submission of project proposals by them, their adherence to relevant scheme guidelines, submission of suitable Detailed Project Reports, availability of funds and utilization of funds released for projects sanctioned earlier.

4.       There is no provision of taking up the infrastructure development projects directly by the Ministry of Tourism under its schemes.
 
5.	With a view to act upon your several representations and meetings with senior officers, and under directions from the Ministry of Tourism, this office had undertaken a site visit to explore the possibilities of developing Beri Panchpota as an Eco-tourism spot. The relevant report dated 24.06.2022 was sent to the Niche Tourism Division of the Ministry of Tourism. The report, inter alia, stated that Beri Panchpota has the potential to become an Eco-tourism spot subject to creation and development of some civic amenities as well as tourism infrastructure and that many interventions in these areas may be required from the Government.

6.	The said report of this office was forwarded by the Ministry of Tourism to the Govt. of West Bengal, with a request to take further necessary action in this regard.

Sir,


        After meeting reg development of Beri Panchpota Ecotourism with Honorable Secretary (Central Tourism Ministry) Mr. Arvind Singh, nearly Eight months passed. There was no initiative to build Ecotourism at Beri Panchpota till now. The development of the Beri Panchpota Ecotourism center will benefit millions of people in at least three assembly constituencies in West Bengal. We want, this tourism project should be developed in collaboration with the central and state government both.


         I would request you to look into the matter.

Respected Sir, 
This is with reference to the issue i have faced for which i would like to lodge complaint against BSNL Kalyani Exchange wherein they have issued Duplicate SIM which is in my mother&#39;s name (Aruna Chakraborty) without my permission and knowledge hence I would like to register this complaint and would like necessary actions to be taken.

BSNL Kalyani Exchange which has carried out this transaction in issuance of the SIM Card on 17th Dec 2022 was confirmed with BSNL customer care on the said date for the following number: X4X7X2X3X2

I would also like to inform you that I will be taking legal actions for the same as because of this mistake in issuing the SIM without verifying the details has caused financial fraud in my savings account on 19th Dec 2022 amounting to Rs.13,74,000.

I also went to Kalyani BSNL exchange on 22nd Dec and they have shared the documents with which the Duplicate SIM was issued and on looking at those we could clearly see the documents were fake and were not verified by BSNL Officials.

I am also attaching the fake documents I have received from the exchange which was used to issue the SIM Card along with the Original Document.

Regards,
Anita Rao (Chakraborty)

On examination of the grievance filed and the attachments enclosed, it is submitted that the petitioner is filing vague petitions and is requesting to grant rewards for the petitions filed by him. In this regard, it is submitted that Reward is given based on the detection of undisclosed income on the basis of information provided by the petitioner. However, in the present case, the petitioner filed grievance seeking reward as per Income Tax Reward Scheme to help and support his unemployment and poverty referring to earlier petitions filed by him with various officers and investigation agencies which were already disposed. Since no new information was provided by the petitioner in grievance excepting requesting the interim reward as per Income Tax Reward Scheme, the question of reward does not arise and his grievance petition is disposed accordingly.

Subject: Complaint Letter for withholding my (X-X-X-X-X) EPF amount of Rs. 3218904 and for Cheating by company Infoblox (X-X-X-X-X) for not matching Employee contribution to Employer contribution.

Respected Sir/ Madam,

        I‚Äå Shankar Ganesh P.J (Employee XDX X0X0X8 and PAN# X-X-X-X-X)., from 24th April 2017 till 15th December 2021 was working as Staff Engineer at Infoblox Technical Support and Software Development Private Limited, Unit No 02 in Office 1 (Level 4), Golden Heights, Dr. Rajkumar Road, 1/2, 59th C Cross, 4th M Block, Rajajinagar Bangalore ‚Äì 560 010.

Member ID/Name: X-X-X-X-X / SHANKAR GANESH P J
UAN: X0X3X7X6X2X7

To hide their fraud, the company Infoblox has not provided my EPF, Form-16 for the financial year 2021 to 2022 and deliberately withheld my Form-16, all Tax statements, payslips showing break-up, gross &amp; net salary. Infoblox is intentionally doing this to harass me. Even after submitting my grievance XOXEX/X/X0X2X0X9X6 in EPFO, still my EPF money was not transferred by Infoblox. Infoblox deliberately did not mark my Exit and also I got cheated by Infoblox for (X-X-X-X-X) for not matching Employee contribution to Employer contribution ratio. I am bringing this to your kind attention.


 I humbly pray and request you to initiate appropriate action as against Infoblox Technical Support and Software Development Private Limited to match Employee contribution to Employer contribution, mark my Exit and kindly request you to recover my EPF amount from Infoblox and transfer to my current EPF account with interest.

 

Your faithfully,

60," The reply of 6 numbers of PG cases by Shri Rajesh Kumar Bagarti regarding poor network connectivity and installation of  new RJIO tower under USOF scheme at four villages of Deogarh district, one village of Nayagarh and one village of Koraput district is attached as ANNEXURE. ","Telecommunications >> Suggestions >> Others
-----------------------
Honourable Minister Department of Telecommunications, Government of India.
(Grievance-Dear Sir, I would like to draw your urgent attention that Nepal village which comes under the Banthapur Gramapanchyat of Odagaon Block in Nayagarh District of Odisha State. It is an undeveloped hill cum inter remote area and has been cut out from other part of mainstream area of this country since long time. The network connectivity and internet penetration for Telecommunication is very poor and even not working properly. The residents of this village, students and other business personalities are unable to access the internet for their banking and other online services. The students are also unable to attend any online activities due to above mentioned problems. The people are unable to call the ambulance, fire services due to the lack of network problem during emergency time. The facilities of digital India has not reached to these area till now. They have been underprivileged and digitally not connected with rest of the country. 
Therefore, I kindly request you to please install a new Reliance Jio-4G/5G cum BSNL-3G/4G/5G Mobile Tower under the scheme of Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) at the particular place of Nepal village which comes under the Banthapur Gramapanchyat of Odagaon Block in Nayagarh District of Odisha State. So that these underprivileged people will be connected digitally and can take the advantages of digital services.)",Telecommunications,1,3,"['Telecommunications', 'Suggestions', 'Others']","[1, 9, 60]"

It is brought to the notice of SUN DIRECT that the first channel after the setup is turned on,turns out to be a Tamil Channel.  Its a great matter of shame that this dth operator doesnt display channels accordance to the state or region. What do people of Telangana understand Tamil as startup channel and what do people of Karnataka understand channel of Tamil i.e Sun Tv . How do illerate people understand how to operate channels if they are not properly arranged in order of their dwelling states. Management should have minimum knowledge to correct and address these changes. Pathetic and poor customer care officers, even the appellate authority seems to be weird in addressing reagional channels on startup. Local cable operators and MSO are far better than a South operated dth operator like yours,who doesnt even understand customer needs. Secondly, issue of very less news channels in telugu whereas there are so many channels in tamil language. Its a language discrimination and barrier setup by your firm. You being operator from from Tamil Nadu doesnt mean that you favour only customers of Tamil Nadu and leave other people interest. Im gonna seriously write to TRAI and MSO forum on the same on the discrimination of channel preference as per states.",Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,5587,3,"['Ministry of Information and Broadcasting', 'DTH Matters', 'Any Other']","[5587, 6460, 6520]"
2398," With reference to the grievance, it is informed that the complainant cum member has applied for transfer from X-X-X-X-X to X-X-X-X-X. Although Regional office Noida settled the transfer claim form 13 but the transferred amount could not be credited to the member id X-X-X-X-X, as investigation is going on against the establishment M/s D K Construction bearing code Number X-X-X-X-X for doing some suspicious activities. It observed that recently many member of the establishment have taken transfer from other region and after working less than a month, they have approved for final settlement from member id of this establishment. This case is one of the many cases which comes under fraud committed by certain bogus/fraudulent employer who has shown employees working in some other establishment as his own employee by linking their existing UAN and thereby attaining the right to modify the KYC of such employees. This type of fraud has been clarified as ‚ÄúChandigarh‚Äù type of fraud by the Head Office of EPFO. As the activity of the establishment is found to be suspicious at this stage, final decision in the matter will be taken after receipt of the investigation report from the Enforcement officer. Hence, the complainant may be advised to wait for some time till the final outcome of the investigation	SHASHI BHUSHAN KUMAR (RPFC I)	","Labour and Employment >> Transfer related issues >> Transfer in/out/Form 13/ Online transfer related issues

Respected Sir

        He got a job on a compassionate basis. But he produces false/fake documents at the time of appointment on compassionate grounds. It&#39;s a subject of investigation. 
       Kindly verify his documents and their both sisters documents so that you come to a conclusion.
       At the time of birth of Md. Salim on 01/04/1985 his Father Name was Md. Husain after his Younger Sister‚Äôs birth on 15/09/1990 her Father Name was Md. Ainul Haque and her Mother‚Äôs name is same  Halima Khatun.
     Where is his other father? Which he has not mentioned anywhere. It could also mean that he had killed her and thrown her away. It comes under suspicion. It is also under doubt that which of his father was work in the Railway.
    If he got a job in the name of the first father then what did he do with the second father and if he got a job in the name of the second father then what did he do with the first father. It is often doubted.
    How did he get a compassionate job? 
    In whose name is he doing the job?
    It means he faked something.

Dear Sir,
I have when working in various organizations since last 11 years and I have never faced issue in making EPF &amp; EPS transfer and I thank you for that. But my last claim got reject saying my father&#39;s name is incorrect and EPS not deposited because of my organizations mistake.

My previous organization has made multiple requests to correct the father&#39;s name and EPS deposit, even after 6 months the issue has not be resolved.

Since I do not stay in Maharashtra it is difficult for me to travel to PF office Bandra to get this sorted physically. So requesting you to sort this issue with smooth transfer of EPF &amp; EPS to new PF account.

Bank : Other / Private Sector Bank.
Branch / Name of Bank and Branch : Axis Bank, Kondotty
Account Number : X1X0X0X1X2X6X2X
-----------------------
My account is a NRO prime scheme account which requires Rs.25000 as monthly balance, I am maintaining this balance for last 3 months (attached the statement).  I am getting repeated emails about Non-maintenance of minimum balance for my Axis bank account (attached the email received on X1X1X/X0X2X) even though my account has the required minimum balance. 
The bank changes its minimum balance requirement without intimating the customer and deducts Rs.600 for non-maintenance of minimum balance. I have emailed/telephoned several times to the branch (Axis bank-Kondotty) to resolve this issue.  I wanted to close my bank account in this branch due to poor customer service.
The bank offererd to convert my account to a normal account with minimum balance requirement of Rs 5000, but did not do that too.
I have visited Axis Bank, Kondotty branch several times during June-July 2022 for closure of my bank account in this branch.  I have submitted the necessary forms for closing the account. But no action has been taken yet from bank‚Äôs side for the same.
I have also submitted the form for cancelation of a standing order on an expired credit card and no update has been received regarding this till date.
I am no longer interested to keep an account in this bank.
Kindly direct the bank to close this account via online after giving option to transfer the balance amount to other bank account via online. There is no provision to back home to cancel this account, which I did months back and no action was taken from bank‚Äôs side.
PS: I am abroad currently and cannot visit the branch for any procedures. Please facilitate further action if any online.",Banking,251,3,"['Banking', 'Service Charges Related', 'Non-maintenance of Minimum Balance']","[251, 261, 327]"
