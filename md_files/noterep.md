NoteRep
An Open-Source Notes Sharing Platform

I know you all are tired of searching through endless className groups for that one PDF. And that's how NoteRep was born
to solve it. With NoteRep, all the materials are conveniently organized for you to access and use at your fingertips.
I encourage you to bookmark this page or add these folders to your Google Drive's Starred list. You can also share our
website directly on Whatsapp to help other students benefit from these resources.
