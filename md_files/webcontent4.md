renowned visionary, philanthropist, and a pioneer in creating several landmark infrastructure projects in India.
Noticing the shortage of talented engineering professionals required to build a modern India, Dr. M S Ramaiah envisioned
MSRIT as an institute of excellence imparting quality and affordable education. Part of Gokula Education Foundation,
MSRIT has grown over the years with significant contributions from various professionals in different capacities, ably
led by Dr. M S Ramaiah himself, whose personal commitment has seen the institution through its formative years. Today,
MSRIT stands tall as one of India’s finest names in Engineering Education and has produced around 35,000 engineering
professionals who occupy responsible positions across the globe.
